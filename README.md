# Bruce Hall VR Tour 2

This is the second iteration of my Bruce Hall VR Tour. The first project can be found [here](https://github.com/HarveyD/bruce-hall-vr).

The first iteration of the project was made using JQuery. I wasn't 100% happy with how it turned out and wasn't happy how unstructure the code was. I decided to revisit how the website looked in a new project. I also took this opportunity to use React which I am currently learning.

Instead of using a map view, I decided to just go with a more simple UI consisting of a bunch of boxes, with each representing a section of Bruce Hall. Clicking on the box will load the according 360 degree photo. I found this looks much better and gives a better user experience.

This project was made using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
